# Hand Gesture Recognition System

This project uses TensorFlow's object detection to recognize hand gestures. It includes scripts for image collection, model training, and real-time gesture detection.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition:** Utilizes TensorFlow's object detection to recognize hand gestures.
- **Image Collection Script:** Captures data using a camera and handles labeling.
- **Training and Detection Script:** Employs a pre-trained model on the collected data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
